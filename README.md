Club Penumbra Read Me
=====================

Built by Alla Hoffman while at Launch Academy
Club Penumbra is a character-keeper app for the table-top rpg Shadowrun 4th Edition. You can look at an example character without signing up here: http://clubpenumbra.herokuapp.com/characters/1. 

It allows users to keep track of their characters with an intuitive interface, while still accurately modeling the characters' skills, qualities, connections, and all their different kinds of gear. It calculates derived stats for the user and has an in-app dice roller that counts successes and notes glitches for you.

Club Penumbra built in Rails 4 on a Postgresql database that looks like this:

On the front end, it makes use of JQuery and AJAX to streamline the user's experience and uses the Bourbon/Neat/Bitters
framework.
