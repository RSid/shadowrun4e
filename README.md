Club Penumbra is a character-keeper app for the table-top rpg Shadowrun 4th Edition

Hosted here: http://clubpenumbra.herokuapp.com/

It allows users to keep track of their characters with an intuitive interface,
while still accurately modeling the characters' skills, qualities, connections,
and all their different kinds of gear. It calculates derived stats for the user
and has an in-app dice roller that counts successes and notes glitches for you.

It's built using Rails 4 on a Postgresql database, and makes use of JQuery and
AJAX to streamline the user's experience. It also uses the Bourbon/Neat/Bitters
framework on the front end.
